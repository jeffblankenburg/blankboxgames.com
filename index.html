                        To those that have been following Blank Box Games with interest, I have some bad news.</br></br>
                        As of today, the idea behind Blank Box Games has ended.  Our goal was to create a monthly subscription box that could simultaneously deliver on two promises:</br></br>
                        1) A brand new, never-before-released game at your doorstep every month.</br>
                        2) An opportunity for game developers to get their amazing games into the hands of their fans.</br></br>
                        On point #1, there are a number of challenges involved in producing a board game.  Manufacturing those games in a timely and cost-effective manner is certainly one of the biggest of those challenges.  I had made some good progress in working with a few domestic manufacturers, but I consistently found the cost to be too high, or the quality to be too low.  I still believe this is a solvable problem.</br></br>
                        On point #2, we found an outpouring of interest and support.  Game developers from around the world reached out to show us what they had been working on, and in many cases, we were blown away by the concepts, artwork, and fun that these games contained.  This was the challenge we expected to be the most difficult, and overwhelmingly people believed in our idea and wanted to participate.</br></br>
                        The reason that we have to end this adventure falls completely on me.  Blank Box Games was a side venture that received attention when I wasn't working at my "day job."  As part of my contractual obligation to my employer, I recently discovered that I cannot participate in a business like Blank Box Games, and have to remove myself from its operations immediately.  I don't blame my employer, as this was spelled out in my employment agreement.  It was my interpretation of this agreement that faltered, and led me to the point where I am now writing this letter.</br></br>
                        I want to personally apologize to all of the people I have let down because of this situation: the game developers, the manufacturers, and especially my friend Jeff Bellinger.  His tireless work to identify and engage with folks that are making some incredible games was the lifeblood of this organization, and there is no way that Blank Box Games would have happened without his infectious enthusiasm for this idea and the industry.</br></br>
                        I want to offer my sincere apology to everyone affected by this decision, and I hope that we will still be able to see your games on shelves in the very near future.</br></br>
                        Thank you for your support in all of this,</br></br>
                        Jeff Blankenburg
